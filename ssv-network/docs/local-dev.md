# SSV Network

### [Intro](../README.md) | [Architecture](architecture.md) | [Setup](setup.md) | [Tasks](tasks.md) |  Local development

## Running against a local node / testnet
You can deploy and run this contracts in a local node like Hardhat's, Ganache, etc. or public testnets. This guide will cover the process.

### Run [Setup](setup.md)
Execute the steps to setup all tools needed.

### Configure Environment
Copy [.env.example](../.env.example) to `.env` and edit to suit.
- `[NETWORK]_ETH_NODE_URL` RPC URL of the node
- `[NETWORK]_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY` Private key of the deployer account, without 0x prefix
`GAS_PRICE` example 30000000000
`GAS` example 8000000
`ETHERSCAN_KEY` etherescan API key to verify deployed contracts
`SSVTOKEN_ADDRESS` SSV Token contract address
`MINIMUM_BLOCKS_BEFORE_LIQUIDATION` number of blocks before the cluster enters into liquidatable state. Example: 214800 = 30 days
`OPERATOR_MAX_FEE_INCREASE` the fee increase limit in percentage with this format: 100%  =  10000, 10% = 1000 - using 10000 to represent 2 digit precision
`DECLARE_OPERATOR_FEE_PERIOD` the period in which an operator can declare a fee change (seconds)
`EXECUTE_OPERATOR_FEE_PERIOD` the period in which an operator fee change can be executed (seconds)
`VALIDATORS_PER_OPERATOR_LIMIT` the number of validators an operator can manage
`SSVNETWORK_PROXY_ADDRESS` SSVNetwork proxy address, set it when runnning upgrade-ssv-network.ts script
`SSVNETWORKVIEWS_PROXY_ADDRESS` SSVNetworkViews proxy address, set it when runnning upgrade-ssv-network-views.ts script

#### Network configuration
In [hardhat.config.ts](../hardhat.config.ts) you can find specific configs for different networks, that are taken into account only when the `[NETWORK]_ETH_NODE_URL` parameter in `.env` file is set.
For example, in `.env` file you can set:
```
GOERLI_ETH_NODE_URL="https://goerli.infura.io/v3/..."
GOERLI_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY="d79d.."
```
That means Hardhat will pick `config.networks.goerli` section in `hardhat.config.ts` to set the network parameters.

### Start the local node
To run the local node, execute the command in a separate terminal.

```sh
npx hardhat node
```
For more details about it and how to use MainNet forking you can find [here](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/).

### Deployment
The inital deployment process involves the deployment of all main modules (SSVClusters, SSVOperators, SSVDAO and SSVViews), SSVNetwork and SSVNetworkViews contracts.

To run the deployment, execute:
```sh
npx hardhat run --network <your-network> scripts/deploy-all.ts
```
Output of this action will be:

```sh
Deploying contracts with the account:0xf39...
SSVOperators module deployed to: 0x5Fb...
SSVClsuters module deployed to: 0xe7f1...
SSVDAO module deployed to: 0x9fE4...
SSVViews module deployed to: 0xCf7E...
Deploying SSVNetwork with ssvToken 0x3a9f...
SSVNetwork proxy deployed to: 0x5FC8...
SSVNetwork implementation deployed to: 0xDc64...
Deploying SSVNetworkViews with SSVNetwork 0x5FC8...
SSVNetworkViews proxy deployed to: 0xa513...
SSVNetworkViews implementation deployed to: 0x0165...
```
As general rule, you can target any network configured in the `hardhat.config.ts`, specifying the right [network]_ETH_NODE_URL and [network]_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY in `.env` file.

### Verification on etherscan (only public networks)
You can now go to Etherscan and see:
- `SSVNetwork` proxy contract is deployed to the address shown previously in `SSVNetwork proxy deployed to`
- `SSVNetwork` implementation contract is deployed to the address shown previously in `SSVNetwork implementation deployed to`
- `SSVNetworkViews` proxy contract is deployed to the address shown previously in `SSVNetworkViews proxy deployed to`
- `SSVNetworkViews` implementation contract is deployed to the address shown previously in `SSVNetworkViews implementation deployed to`

Open `.openzeppelin/<network>.json` file and find `[impls.<hash>.address]` value which is implementation smart contract address.
You will find 2 `[impls.<hash>]` entries, one for `SSVNetwork` and another for `SSVNetworkViews`.
Run this verification process for both.

You can take it from the output of the `deploy-all.ts` script.

To verify an implementation contract (SSVNetwork, SSVNetworkViews or any module), run this:

```sh
npx hardhat verify --network <network> <implementation-address>
```

Output of this action will be:
```sh
Nothing to compile
No need to generate any newer typings.
Successfully submitted source code for contract
contracts/SSVNetwork.sol:SSVNetwork at 0x2279B7...
for verification on the block explorer. Waiting for verification result...

Successfully verified contract SSVNetwork on Etherscan.
https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x227...#code
```

After this action, you can go to the proxy contract in Etherscan and start interacting with it.
