# SSV Network Smart Contracts

### Intro | [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) | [Setup](./docs/setup.md) | [Tasks](./docs/tasks.md) | [Local development](./docs/local-dev.md)

This repository contains the Solidity smart contracts for the SSV Network. The SSV Network is a decentralized network for the operation of Ethereum validators. It allows for secure, scalable, and decentralized staking on the Ethereum blockchain. The key elements of this system are represented through several Ethereum smart contracts, all of which are outlined below.

The documentation is divided into different sections:

- **Architecture** Provides an overview of the system an all its components.
- **Setup** Basic setup of the repository to be able to compile the contracts, run tests, etc.
- **Tasks** Detailed instructions to run useful tools, deploy and updagrade the contracts.
- **Local development** Guide to setup the local environment to work with the contracts.

## SSV Documentation

Check the **[Smart contracts](https://docs.ssv.network/developers/smart-contracts)** official documentation for more information about contracts' functionalities, official releases, etc.
