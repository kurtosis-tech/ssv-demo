y0sher [ SSV.Network ] â€” 06/04/2023 3:37 PM
Hi @gyani , our dev guide describes creating the events.yaml file, we should probably add there that this file is a debugging and testing env replacement for actually reading the events from the contract. So in the regular env what will happen is that operators will be registered to the contract using their operator keys, then validators will deposit ETH stake and register to the contract as validators in SSV and choose 4 (or more but we can focus on this case at first) operators to run their duties.
and then the node reads the contract events using an ETH EL node.
gyani â€” 06/05/2023 4:01 PM
Interesting! And as weâ€™re deploying the contract we donâ€™t need to do this step? Based on the existing code base do we just have to go from 1 to 4 nodes then?
y0sher [ SSV.Network ] â€” 06/06/2023 8:03 AM
Well yeah this should work. Also we might not even need bootnode as discovery with mdns might work here.

gyani â€” 06/06/2023 4:08 PM
So the first node can be the boot node while the other 3 can read from it; should be enough! Got it. Will get you something soon.
y0sher [ SSV.Network ] â€” 06/06/2023 5:30 PM
Maybe this also is not needed. I'm pretty sure we have discovery by mdns, that should work in a dockerized environment
Just like Ethereum
gyani â€” 06/06/2023 7:10 PM
^ so with a recent change I can start 4 number of nodes; they all run and connect to ethereum. Should I be seeing some chatter between them?

Do the logs make sense? Should I be seeing chatter between the nodes? 
gyani â€” 06/06/2023 8:12 PM
I haven't made any mdns configuration changes; i am hoping they can just discover each other
gyani â€” 06/06/2023 8:31 PM
@y0sher [ SSV.Network ]  i am now starting the first node with start-boot-node and the other nodes I start with start-node ; in the other nodes configuration i pass the ip off the first node mimicing https://github.com/bloxapp/ssv/blob/2fb5cff5820757daf5d93f182e40a95bc9d130ec/config/config.example.yaml#L31-L33 I am not sure what to put for the private key

Hey @y0sher [ SSV.Network ] I am curious if you got a chance to try the above ^
y0sher [ SSV.Network ] â€” 06/08/2023 8:44 AM
Will take a look at it in a few
Lior [SSV.Network | BloxStaking] â€” 06/08/2023 9:25 AM
Hi @gyani,
a node canâ€™t run as a node and a boot node.

here is my suggestion,
if the nodes run on the same server then use mdns by adding in config:
Image
regarding operator privatekey,
please check the guide:
https://docs.ssv.network/run-a-node/operator-node/
Operator Node
Basically you need to generate the private key first and then provide it using the config
gyani â€” 06/08/2023 5:52 PM
@Lior [SSV.Network | BloxStaking] They will run on different containers but have a shared interface! I can add the p2p config! Alright so 
I will generate keys per node at the moment I was using a generated value and copying it over nodes. This has to be unique per node I am guessing? Or can I have the same operator key accross nodes? I just copied one of your example PK/SK pairs.
You wrote that a node cannot be a node and a boot node; in my code I've made the 1st node the boot node and the others nodes. Is that okay? The bootnode configuration seems to require two things - ExternalIP and PrivateKey. For the external IP I can provide the private key of the 1st node? What do I provide for the private key here? Does a bootnode require any special configuration?
It seems like every node I start needs to be registered as well - I have to call the registerOperator (publicKey, operatorFee) from every node as everynode if every node has its own private key. Is that correct?

Hello @Lior [SSV.Network | BloxStaking]& @y0sher [ SSV.Network ] ! First, thank you both for iterating with us as we try to get the ssv-demo package into a state where its usable for your team. 

Would one of you (or Moshe) be open to hopping on a call for an hour next week to get the last bits of SSV-specific logic added to the package?  We can teach & ramp you guys up on the Kurtosis concepts and Starlark, but need help with the SSV side of things. A call would help @gyani get the context much faster and speed things up. Here's our Calendly with some slots friendly to your timezone: https://calendly.com/kurtosis/call-with-kurtosis-derek-gyani 
Derek | Kurtosis â€” 06/08/2023 6:47 PM
Otherwise, we know you guys are busy with the upcoming release of your first mainnet candidate and so we can engage in the future too. We want to be respectful of your time and priorities!

While we're more than happy to help you guys on-board and get started, we are a small startup and have existing, active users we'd like to support. You know where to find us if you're still open to chatting ðŸ™‚ 
Lior [SSV.Network | BloxStaking] â€” 06/08/2023 6:54 PM
Thanks, letâ€™s schedule something next week
gyani â€” 06/08/2023 7:22 PM

y0sher [ SSV.Network ] â€” 06/19/2023 3:06 PM
Hi guys, sorry it seems like @Lior [SSV.Network | BloxStaking] and @Moshe [Blox Staking] & [SSV] are unavailable, we might need to reschedule
Derek | Kurtosis â€” 06/19/2023 3:08 PM
Okay, no worries! Would any of these slots work for a re-schedule? https://calendly.com/kurtosis/call-with-kurtosis-derek-gyani 

Let me know if not, I can move stuff around for us. @y0sher [ SSV.Network ]

@Lior [SSV.Network | BloxStaking] @Moshe [Blox Staking] & [SSV] @y0sher [ SSV.Network ] It was fun chatting. From the call there were a few FLUPs for you guys
Can you send me examples of registerOperator ,registerValidators and the key tool key splitting/encryption. I believe you said there's some automation/code that's already written. If I can see that then I can implement it in Kurtosis
We discussed how eth2.Network for now( bloxstaking/ssv-node:latest image) can be set to prater/pyrmont/mainnet. It seems like recently there's been some work to change it to mainnet, jato-v2-stage, jato-v2. I am for now passing prater and that might lead to some limitations; and we want to be able to pass testnet etc.


I'll be creating an issue for 2 on your GH. Do you think its worth me doing the registerOperator / registerValidator work while I am only able to set prater?

Hi @Andrew [ssv.network | Blox] ,
Do we have an example script we can share with @gyani 

for register operator and register validator (that uses ssv keys) from keystore?
gyani â€” Yesterday at 4:04 PM
Hey @Andrew [ssv.network | Blox] ^ pinging you again about the above ðŸ™‚
Andrew [ssv.network | Blox] â€” Yesterday at 4:29 PM
Hey @gyani sorry for the wait on this i would be glad to share some scripts that i whipped together.  Please keep in mind these are not production grade and need a lot of work to be added to them to handle errors and exact flows that you might want to achieve etc... 

I am using hardhat to deploy these scripts, some of the things here might not be fully understandable as the comments are not great and some other things are needed such as the actual contracts to compile and build abi, jsons of operators ids, keystores etc... Please let me know if you have any question regarding structure of a json, an import etc... and i would be glad to help

Thanks Andrew! This looks useful ðŸ™‚  I have just skimmed through the code and it makes sense to me so far. If I run into any pitfalls I'll reach out to you ðŸ™‚ . I'll probably go dive deep into it tomorrow morning London time and will have questions for you by later in the day if I run into troubles

yeah so its not public and i figured we would get to a package.json ðŸ™‚ .  This is from a folder of personal scripts that i whipped together when needed and package.json is a bit large.  I will send what i have but there might be a bit there that is unnecessary
